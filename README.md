# FirstStack
This is my first full-stack app that uses Express to serve a homepage.


## Motivation
I used this to learn more about [Node.js (and Express)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENrzD9HAZK4).


## Pre-requisite Tools
The following tools need to be installed to run this project:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html)


## Instructions
To run this application on Windows, follow these instructions:
1. Clone this repository onto your machine.
2. Open a terminal, and navigate to the project folder.
3. Open the `node_modules/debug/.coveralls.yml` file, and add the value for `repo_token`.
4. Then enter the following command to run the app: `node .`
5. Use the localhost link display to access the page.
